    <h1>Information about me</h1>
    <p>I grew up in a harbor town in Sweden and that's where I have remained throughout my life. I like it here, perhaps because of it's familiarity.</p>
    <p>If I would have to explain myself to someone, I would use a word that is said several times during my life "Kind", that's the word. Kind, if I agree with it I don't know. I do try to be the best of myself towards others, but if I am I don't know.</p>
    <p>Also, a little information surrounding this website, it's a test. A practice site for me to learn and become better at HTML,CSS and eventually Javascript.</p>
